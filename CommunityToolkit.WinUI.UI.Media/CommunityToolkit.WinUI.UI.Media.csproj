    <Description>
      This library provides UI effects which rely on Win2D. It is a part of the Windows Community Toolkit.

      AttachedCardShadow: Provides an easy-to-use, simple, and performant rounded-rectangle shadow effect.

      Effects:
      - AcrylicEffect: A custom acrylic effect that can be inserted into a pipeline.
      - BackdropEffect: A backdrop effect that can sample from a specified source.
      - BlendEffect: A blend effect that merges the current pipeline with an input one.
      - BlurEffect: A gaussian blur effect.
      - ImageEffect: An effect which displays an image loaded as a Win2D surface.
      - ShadeEffect: An effect that overlays a color layer over the current pipeline, with a specified intensity.
      - SolidColorEffect: An effect that renders a standard 8bit SDR color on the available surface.
      - TileEffect: An effect that loads an image and replicates it to cover all the available surface area.
      - ExposureEffect, GrayscaleEffect, HueRotationEffect and more, mapping to Win2D effects.

      Geometry:
      - CanvasPathGeometry: A class that parses Win2d Path Mini Language and converts it to CanvasGeometry, CanvasBrush, CanvasStroke, CanvasStrokeStyle or Color.

      Helpers:
      - SurfaceLoader: A class that can load and draw images and other objects to Win2D surfaces and brushes.

      Media:
      - AcrylicBrush: A custom Brush that that implements an acrylic effect with full control over all parameters.
      - BackdropBlurBrush: The BackdropBlurBrush is a Brush that blurs whatever is behind it in the application.
      - BackdropGammaTransferBrush: A brush which alters the colors of whatever is behind it in the application by applying a per-channel gamma transfer function.
      - BackdropInvertBrush: The BackdropInvertBrush is a Brush which inverts whatever is behind it in the application.
      - BackdropSaturationBrush: Brush which applies a SaturationEffect to the Backdrop.
      - BackdropSepiaBrush: Brush which applies a SepiaEffect to the Backdrop.
      - CanvasBrushBase: Helper Brush class to interop with Win2D Canvas calls.
      - ImageBlendBrush: A Brush which blends a BitmapImage to the Backdrop in a given mode.
      - PipelineBrush: A Brush that renders a customizable Composition/Win2D effects pipeline
      - RadialGradientBrush: This GradientBrush defines its Gradient as an interpolation within an Ellipse.
      - TilesBrush: A Brush that displays a tiled image, wrapping at the edges and endlessly repeating.

      PipelineBuilder: A class that allows to build custom effects pipelines and create CompositionBrush instances from them.
